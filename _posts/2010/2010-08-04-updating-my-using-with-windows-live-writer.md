I didn't know about this sophisticated application so called “[Windows Live Writer](https://explore.live.com/windows-live-writer)”. Actually quiet frequently I was looking for an HTML editor to write my blog post and then update my blog. Because HTML edit which comes with BlogEngine.Net is not easy to use – and its the same problem with all web based HTML editor-. To be honest windows live writer is something more than what I expected.

I was reading an article about [AtomPub Using WCF Data](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-au/magazine/ff872392.aspx), I came across Windows Live Writer which surprisingly supports BlogEngine.Net (Its better to say that BlogEnine.Net supports AtomPub which is protocol for publishing content).

Windows Live Writer easily installed on my machine. After installation completed you will be asked about your blog information and if your blog supports AtomPub then you can continue to enter login information of your blog. With a quick search I found in [WiKi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Live_Writer)that Windows Live Writer supports BlogEngine.Net so I selected “other blog service” option in this form.

In next step you’ll be asked about your blog address and username and password.

For me as a developer it was surprising that Windows Live Writer supports plug-ins. first thing I looked for was [SyntaxHighlighter](https://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/). Yes! . I’s already been developed. there is a project in CodePlex named "[SyntaxHighlighter for Windows Live Writer](https://wlwsyntaxhighlighter.codeplex.com/)” you can easily download and set it up.
