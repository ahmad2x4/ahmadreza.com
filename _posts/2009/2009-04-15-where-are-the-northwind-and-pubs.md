<span>SQL Server 2005 is installed without any samples - at least versions I installed don't contain Northwind and pubs databases -. However Microsoft put <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/SqlServerSamples"><span style="color:blue;">SQL Server 2005 Samples and Sample Databases</span></a> in Codeplex, light version of these two sample databases were always famous in a way that you can find one of them in most database related samples with high probability.<span>&#160; </span>You can find SQL Server 2000 Sample <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=06616212-0356-46A0-8DA2-EEBC53A68034"><span style="color:blue;">here</span></a>. After installation file is downloaded take following two steps:</span>
  <p style="line-height:normal;margin:0 0 0 9pt;" class="MsoNormal">
  <p style="line-height:normal;margin:0 0 0 9pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>1. Install msi file. Some files will be copied in C:\SQL Server 2000 Sample Databases       
2. Attach Northwind.mdf file which is located in C:\SQL Server 2000 Sample Databases. Repeat this step for pubs mdf file. </span>
