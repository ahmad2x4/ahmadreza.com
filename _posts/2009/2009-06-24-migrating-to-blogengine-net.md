![](http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/themes/blogenginehome/images/benlogo80.gif)Finally, I've decided to convert my weblog engine from [Graffiti CMS](http://www.graffiticms.com/) to [BlogEngine](http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/). Moving to BlogEngine doesn't mean weakness of Graffiti blogging engine or indicating any problem. But after surveying BlogEngine and comparing to current version of Graffity CMS I've found lots of features more sophisticated than Graffiti and in my opinion blogEngine is handier. Although you can full features [here ](http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/page/Feature-table.aspx)but in my opinion following features are cool and convincing to migrate:
  <p style="font-family:calibri;font-size:11pt;margin:0 0 0 .375in;">
  

*   <span style="font-family:calibri;font-size:11pt;">Easy installation</span> 
*   <span style="font-family:calibri;font-size:11pt;">Cool widgets</span> 
*   <span style="font-family:calibri;font-size:11pt;">Advanced comment system (Supporting Nested reply)</span> 
*   <span style="font-family:calibri;font-size:11pt;">Cool themes (more themes are available on web)</span> 
*   <span style="font-family:calibri;font-size:11pt;">Supporting ping service</span> 
*   <span style="font-family:calibri;font-size:11pt;">Static pages</span>
