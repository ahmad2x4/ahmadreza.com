  <p style="font-family:calibri;font-size:11pt;margin:0;">Graffiti CMS express edition is popular amid developers as well as Community Server. At the moment I wanted to decide between Graffiti And Community Server&#160; I couldn't made my mind. Blog subsystem of community server has a simple theme which is similar to MSDN blog theme (Like current theme). This theme was inducement of community server. Finally, I used graffiti because of simplicity, anyway , Recently I decided to convert simple theme of community server 2008 to graffiti CMS theme.
