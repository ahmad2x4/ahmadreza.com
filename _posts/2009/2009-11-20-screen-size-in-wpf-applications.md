I was about to write a simple application deal with screen size in WPF. Previously in windows form applications we could get WorkingArea parameters from System.Windows.Forms.WorkingArea but in WPF application typically we donâ€™t have this assembly (however this assembly could be added to project). In WPF applications screen size could be obtained from System.Windows.SystemParameters. Following code is an example of setting a form right-bottom aligned in screen.
 

#### Windows form application:

 <div style="display:inline;float:none;margin:0;padding:0;" id="scid:887EC618-8FBE-49a5-A908-2339AF2EC720:0540c9dc-bb32-44f9-9c92-dd21c7955bb6" class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent">


[sourcecode language="csharp"]
this.Top = Screen.PrimaryScreen.WorkingArea.Height - this.Height;
this.Left = Screen.PrimaryScreen.WorkingArea.Width - this.Width; [/sourcecode]
</pre></div>

    
    #### WPF application:
    
    
<div style="display:inline;float:none;margin:0;padding:0;" id="scid:887EC618-8FBE-49a5-A908-2339AF2EC720:03ee6d9c-208a-4f7e-b2a3-3f1113406375" class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent"><pre>
[sourcecode language="csharp"]
this.Top = System.Windows.SystemParameters.WorkArea.Height - this.Height;
this.Left = System.Windows.SystemParameters.WorkArea.Width - this.Width; [/sourcecode]

</div>


<span style="font-weight:bold;">P.S. 2009/11/30: </span>A friend of mine just asked "Is it possible to get all screen size (in multiple screen) in WPF without refering to System.Windows.Forms". As far as I see, It seems it is not possible to get other screens than current workarea unless you Use System.Windows.Forms.
