I was about to write a simple application deal with screen size in WPF. Previously in windows form applications we could get WorkingArea parameters from System.Windows.Forms.WorkingArea but in WPF application typically we donâ€™t have this assembly (however this assembly could be added to project). In WPF applications screen size could be obtained from System.Windows.SystemParameters. Following code is an example of setting a form right-bottom aligned in screen.
 

#### Windows form application:


``` CSharp 
this.Top = Screen.PrimaryScreen.WorkingArea.Height - this.Height;
this.Left = Screen.PrimaryScreen.WorkingArea.Width - this.Width; [/sourcecode]
```
    
#### WPF application:
    
    
```Csharp 
this.Top = System.Windows.SystemParameters.WorkArea.Height - this.Height;
this.Left = System.Windows.SystemParameters.WorkArea.Width - this.Width; [/sourcecode]
```


P.S. 2009/11/30: 
A friend of mine just asked "Is it possible to get all screen size (in multiple screen) in WPF without refering to System.Windows.Forms". As far as I see, It seems it is not possible to get other screens than current workarea unless you Use System.Windows.Forms.
