title: Nepean triathlong 4th year 
---

Bachground and registration
Nepean triathlon is the oldest triathlon in Australia. I has been around since 1982, when I was only 5 years old. This year was the forth year I have been racing this awesome event. Earlier this year it was not quite clear if Nepean triathlon is going ahead due to 2020 pandaming COVID19,. I hadnt registered until 3 weeks to the race when I was somewhat sure it is going to happen this year. When I saw the facebook post that they are going to have limitted number of copmetitors, I registered immediately. This has been the forth consecutive year I have been racing and I didnt want to miss it. Registered and kept the fingeres crossed that it will go ahead without cancelation. The race is scheduled on Sunday 25th October.

Fitness and prepration:
This year had been a rollercoaster I had a lot of ups and downs in my training plan. There were a few races I had been planning for that did not go ahead and messed up with my training routine. Moreover, swimming pools had been closed for several months from March to the end of July and even when they openen again it was a challange and a bit of risk to go to swimming pool. Generally, I was "maintaining" my fitness during COVID. There was no significant improvement or peaking up to end of September. I was planning to improve my fitness in 6 weeks time leading to the race with the hope that general fitness I was carring would help me to peak in the 6 weeks block. So, as always I signed up for TrainerRoad and this time I the planner to workout my training based on the race day.
I mostly followed the training plan except a few tweaks: I swaped Tuesday structured ride with a group local ride we have called Mt Darkers, I'll blog more about that in future since I am planning to ride with them more. That help me to rack-up some milage since that ride is somewhere between 50-60km. Another change I did to the training plan was to do a bit of more long runs than what was planned in TrainerRoad training plan. However, this one did not go completely according to the plan. I managed to to probably 2 runs
