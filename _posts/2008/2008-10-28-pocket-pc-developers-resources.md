<p style="font-family:calibri;font-size:11pt;margin:0;">Currently, I'm working on Pocket PC development. During last week I've found interesting resources about windows mobile development with .Net compact framework. first of all [Windows Mobile Team Blog ](https://blogs.msdn.com/windowsmobile/)would be a sophisticated resource. Moreover you could find other useful links in this weblog.
  <p style="font-family:calibri;font-size:11pt;margin:0;">
  <p style="font-family:calibri;font-size:11pt;margin:0;">Other blogger's web site would be good resources, like [Chris Craft's Blog](https://www.cjcraft.com/blog/default.aspx). CJ's weblog contains a series of posts for a month. For each day he wrote a post about windows mobile programming. It would be a good starting tutorial for beginners.

  <p style="font-family:calibri;font-size:11pt;margin:0;">Another web site that could be useful is [www.dotnetfordevices.com](https://www.dotnetfordevices.com/) .
  <p style="font-family:calibri;font-size:11pt;margin:0;">However, I'll post related news and experiences during windows mobile development
