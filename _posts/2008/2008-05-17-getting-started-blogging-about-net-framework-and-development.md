Although it wasn't easy for me, finally I made up my mind to create a web log and write my experience and note about .Net issues and development. As far as I concerned many problems I'm recently grappling with are solved by blogs either I previously know or I find in search engines. Since give-and-take is one of basic rules in technical societies, taking advantage of others blogs without giving information does not seem fair. Hopefully, I'll do my best to submit some useful post.

Moreover, I am enthusiastically looking for your comments and I believe that your comments will help me in order to improve my blog.
